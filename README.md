The simplified Refuge water budget model divides the Refuge into two connected compartments or boxes (Figure 1). 
The model integrates net inflow minus outflow for each compartment to provide a daily estimate of stage and volume within each compartment.
The model is implemented as an Excel workbook titled “WaterBudget.xls.”
